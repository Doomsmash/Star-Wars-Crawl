    <h1>A long time in a galaxy far away called </br>Belgium</h1>
    <p>
        It is the story of a young padawan named Thomas, but for reasons of anonymity we will call him Sabrina.
        Sabrina was lost in this galaxy with no idea what to do. 
        But one day she arrived on the planet BeCode. 
        There Sabrina met Mike & Youssef, two jedi code experts. 
        Sabrina wanted to be a jedi code expert too. Mike & Youssef accepted but she had to pass some tests before.
        After passing the tests with the words "Well, she's not that dumb." she could start the training. 
        She began with how to use terminal & Git/Github, after Sabrine continued with HTML & CSS.
        These are two languages dating from a past era that persists through time.
